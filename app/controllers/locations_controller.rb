  # Here is our custom category action; this is lifted almost verbatime from
  # the index action, except that we use the find_all_by_XXX method that
  # Rails gives us, and the params[:category] fragment from the route we
  # created. To double-up on the views, we tell category to render the view
  # in app/views/locations/index.html.erb -- although if the category view
  # were drastically different, we could leave out the render line and just
  # create a view in app/views/locations/category.html.erb
